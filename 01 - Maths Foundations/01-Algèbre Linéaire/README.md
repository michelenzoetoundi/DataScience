# Linear Algebra — Conceptual Foundations

## 📂 Folder Structure and Organization

- **Théorie** → conceptual and formal understanding  
    - **Cours** → Summary of concepts learned  
     - **Exercices** → active appropriation of concepts  
- **Pratique (Octave)** → Projects completed of numerical experimentation to strengthen intuition  

---

## 📚 Topics Covered
- Vectors and vector spaces  
- Matrices as representation tools  
- Matrix operations  
- Linear transformations  
- Dimension and structural properties  
- Geometric interpretation of operations  

---

## 🔗 Connection to the Rest of the Curriculum
Linear algebra is a **foundation**.  
It will be directly reused in:
- statistics (covariance, projections)
- machine learning (regression, PCA, neural networks)
- deep learning (tensors, backpropagation)

Without linear algebra, models become black boxes.
