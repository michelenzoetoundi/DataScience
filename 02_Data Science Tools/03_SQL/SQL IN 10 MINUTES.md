# 📘 SQL IN 10 MINUTES (Ben Forta, 5th Ed.)

## 📝 Abstract
> This book acts as the **extraction interface**. It defines the language used to communicate with relational databases. For a Data Scientist, SQL is the tool that retrieves symbols (data) from storage systems to feed the analytical pipeline.
