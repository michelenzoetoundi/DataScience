# 📘 Programming Logic and Design (Farrell, 10th Ed, 2024)

## 📝 Abstract
> This book serves as a language-agnostic guide to structured programming logic. It focuses on the mental models required to solve complex problems using sequence, selection, and loops. It emphasizes modularization and object-oriented principles, ensuring that the student builds "High-Quality Programs" that are reusable, scalable, and logically sound before moving into specific syntax.

## 🏗️ I. STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS (Topology)
- **👤 Author:** Joyce Farrell.
- **🌐 Global Topology:** **Linear Logic Evolution** 📈. It progresses from basic flowcharting to complex Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
- **⚙️ Global Objective:** To develop "Computational Thinking" into "Program Architecture" using pseudocode and flowcharts.
- **📜 Linearity:** Highly linear. Each chapter introduces a structural constraint (Selection, Looping, Arrays) that is required for the next.

## 🗺️ II. KNOWLEDGE MAPPING (Syllabus)

| Chapter | Title | Key Learning (The Insight) |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **01** | Overview of Computers | The Program Development Cycle: Think before you code. |
| **02** | High-Quality Programs | **Modularization & Reusability**: Breaking systems into manageable units. |
| **03** | Understanding Structure | Eliminating "Spaghetti Code" through Sequence, Selection, and Loops. |
| **04** | Making Decisions | Boolean logic (AND/OR/NOT) and efficiency in nesting. |
| **05** | Looping | Loop control variables, validation, and accumulation. |
| **06** | Arrays | Memory occupancy, parallel arrays, and searching efficiency. |
| **07** | File Handling | Data hierarchy and sequential/random access file operations. |
| **08** | Advanced Data Handling | **Bubble Sort** and Multidimensional Arrays. |
| **09** | Advanced Modularization | Implementation hiding, Cohesion, and Coupling (System Design). |
| **10** | Object-Oriented (OOP) | **Principles of OOP**: Classes, Objects, and Access levels. |

## 🔗 III. SYSTEMIC CONNECTIONS
- **📊 Data Science Impact:** Chapters 6 (Arrays) and 8 (Sorting/Multidimensional Arrays) are the direct precursors to understanding **NumPy** and **Pandas** structures.
- **🛠️ Action:** Focus on **Chapter 9.8 (Cohesion & Coupling)**. This is pure system architecture—ensuring modules are independent yet functional.
- **🧩 Strategic Fit:** This book transforms the "theoretical algorithms" from Book 1 into "structured program logic." It ensures your Python code won't just "work," but will be "elegant."

## 👁️ IV. ARCHITECTURAL SYNTHESIS
- **🧠 System Model:** **The Blueprint.** If Book 1 is the building material, Book 2 is the architectural plan. It defines the flow of energy (logic) through the structure.
- **✨ Act of Philosophy:** **Anti-Spaghetti Logic.** Choosing structure over chaos. It is the act of imposing logical order (Ch. 3) on the "thought provokers" of the world.
