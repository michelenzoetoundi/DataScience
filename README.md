## 🛠️ Skills & Competencies (Current Level)

> The following skills reflect what I can already apply in practice  

### 📐 Mathematics
**Linear Algebra**
- Understand a real world problem and build a mathematical model of it
- Manipulate matrices and vectors to calculate, solve and interpret results
- Translate mathematical problems into computational form

### 💻 Computation & Tools
- Use **GNU Octave** for: numerical linear algebra, matrix-based problem solving, mathematical experimentation
- Write clear and reproducible scripts
- Document reasoning step by step, not only final results

### 🧠 Conceptual & Methodological Skills
- Decompose abstract problems into structured steps
- Focus on **why a method works**, not only how
- Connect mathematical formalism to interpretation
- Learn independently using rigorous academic resources
